Beboist
=======
The Beboist plugin provides a Rails interface to the Bebo Social Networking API.

The plugin was designed from the ground-up to be flexible enough to accommodate
any changes to the API, while at the same time providing a clean interface
that will be familiar to most Rails developers.

Setup
=====
1. Ensure the Beboist plugin is installed in your vendor/plugins folder
2. Generate your config/bebo.yml file using: script/generate beboist_settings
3. Fill in your appropriate app settings in bebo.yml. Ensure that your app name is right.
4. Generate the first migration for your users table using: script/generate beboist_user_migration
5. rake db:migrate
6. In your application.rb, insert the following:
                include BeboControllerExtensions
		before_filter :reject_unadded_users
		before_filter :find_bebo_user
7. Write your app, and keep an eye on your logs to catch any possible error messages.

Notes
=====
- The Beboist plugin uses Bebo's JSON API, and the 'json' gem to directly convert JSON objects to Ruby.
- Works with Rails 2.0+, untested on Rails 1.2.
- Look at the KNOWN_ISSUES file to see a list of currently open issues.
- For a full list of methods, look at lib/bebo_api/bebo_types.rb within the plugin
